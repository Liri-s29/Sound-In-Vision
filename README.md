# Sound In Vision

An application that breaks the communication barrier with people with hearing-impairment. The app translates Human Speech to USL ( Universal Sign Language )

## Understanding the motive
Sign language is a visual language that is used by people with hearing-impairment.

Due to the considerable time required in learning Sign Language, it becomes difficult to communicate with specially-abled people and thus creates a communication gap.

## Solution
Our vision is to develop a mobile application that takes in live speech or audio recording as input, converts itÂ into text and displays the relevant Indian Sign Language images or gestures.

## Technologies Used :
  - Flutter
  - Google Speech API
  - NLP in Python

## To try application

```
git clone https://github.com/Liri-s29/Sound-In-Vision.git
